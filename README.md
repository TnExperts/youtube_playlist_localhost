# youtube_playlist_localhost
	
youtube_raw: -> depreceated. 

youtube_api:
- Streams a YouTube Link, an ID, or even a Playlist to a VLC Instance.
- Make it available on http://localhost:8080/gogo.ts (for use with eg LiveStreaming Apps aka OBS)
- Removed dependency to "youtube-dl" and "ffmpeg"
- Youtube switched some internal logic. So rewrote the playlist fetcher to use an api-Key based approach.

younow:
- A simple YouNow Comment Interface for use with OBS Text Feature.  

stream_tools:
- A set of batchjobs dealing with http streams and vlc.
